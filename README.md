## Feature & Usage

### Load a map in Mapbox GL JSON format

You can add your own map from the tab `From URL`. Add the name of your map and URL to JSON.

For **vector tiles** you can add either URL to style.json or TileJSON. Note that if you add URL to TileJSON you will get only tiles data with basic QGIS styling. For **raster tiles** you have to add URL to TileJSON.

### Vector and raster tiles

MapTiler plugin supports loading maps via both vector and raster tiles.  You can choose from the contextual menu of the map and clicking either on `Add as Raster` or `Add as Vector`.

You can choose the default type of tiles by checking/unchecking `Use vector tiles by default` in the Account dialog window.

Vector tiles support requires QGIS 3.13 or higher.

You can read about the difference between vector and raster tiles here [https://www.maptiler.com/news/2019/02/what-are-vector-tiles-and-why-you-should-care/](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2019/02/what-are-vector-tiles-and-why-you-should-care/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=qgis-plugin)

 
### Customize quickly the look&feel of the base maps 

There is a possibility to simply adjust the default base maps in [Customize tool](https://cloud.maptiler.com/customize/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=qgis-plugin) - via a context menu on right-click in QGIS.

Switch language, select layers, and change colors to match your brand and make a perfect map.

“Save” this map, and add it via URL - by copy&pasting the link to “GL JSON Style” from the Cloud page of the map.

### Geocoding / place search
